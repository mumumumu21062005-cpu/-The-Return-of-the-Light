There was a small village by the river. The name of the village was Chandpur. There was very little light in the lives of the people of the village, because at night, thick darkness would descend, and in that darkness, people would be afraid of the unfriendly shadow Gradually, the darkness fled. The night sky seemed to sparkle with new hope. The villagers understood— Darkness cannot be driven away by turning off the lights, but rather by lighting them. From that day on, there is no place for darkness and fear in Chandpur—there is the light of dreams and courage. Suddenly, a bit of light came to a halt right in front of her. It was something like a tiny firefly! But that firefly could talk. The light has left your village only because the very scary things in your hearts are eating up the light.” Rida was shocked but not fearful. She said,“Is it possible for us to bring the light back?” The firefly smiled and said,“The one who is brave enough to walk in the dark will get the light back.” It was that night when Rida brought all the villagers together. In their company, they invited a thousand fireflies to the riverbank—in the light of their laughter, bravery, and unity. Slowly but surely, the darkness went ​‍​‌‍​‍‌away.# -The-Return-of-the-Light
